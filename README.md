# Discount-Calculator

## Description
This script defines a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. If the discount percentage is **20% or higher**, the discount is applied; otherwise, the original price is returned. I have submitted this as my assignment for the Python module; for the PLP programme.

## Features
- Applies discount only if it is **20% or more**
- Prompts the user to enter the **original price** and **discount percentage**
- Displays the final price formatted to **two decimal places**

## How to Use
- To run the script using Python, enter the following command on the command-line :
```bash
   python app.py
```
- Enter a price and a discount percentage

### Example Run
```
Enter the original price of the item: 200
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Final price after discount: $150.00
